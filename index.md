# About

I am a recent graduate of the Geomatics Masters programme at TU Delft. My Master's thesis was on neural 3D reconstruction and stylization.

Before studying Geomatics, I completed a bachelor in Mathematics at Leiden University, with a minor in Music Science at Utrecht University.

This page will be updated regularly with any projects I think belong here.
